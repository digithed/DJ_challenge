# DJ_challenge
DJ challenge in Python for Dropgenie

Read "musicDJ.txt" in the root of this repository to understand the background/requirements for the challenge.

Run with:
```python3 DJ.py```

Two .txt files will be created in the same directory. One file will be a list of party-goers with their information ("party_list.txt"). Another file will be a copy of the console output ("record.txt").
