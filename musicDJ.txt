Music DJ 

- Context : 
There is a wedding party and there is a DJ that is playing some songs. All of a
sudden, he says : "I am willing to take some requests for songs to be played
next". Then, everybody starts rushing to the DJ booth and there is just a
massive herd of people and it is chaotic. No songs can be played since people
are screaming left and right to play their songs. 

You then come up with an idea to be able to organize better.

Here are the rules :
- if you are a friend of the DJ - the current song is skipped and your song
  plays immediately. 
- otherwise, it is first come first serve.
- there is a time delay of 5 seconds between each requests
- for each request, there is a time limit to it

@ Here is the order of the people that come up to the DJ @
